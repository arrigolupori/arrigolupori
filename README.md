Hey there 👋🏼
========================

I'm Arrigo, Co-Founder & Product Lead at [Sagewill](https://sagewill.com).

*   🇮🇹🇺🇸  I'm based in Firenze, Italy, but my company is registered in the US.
*   💾⛅️  I love working with PostgreSQL and serverless architecture.
*   🪜🔐  My goal is to build highly-available and secure apps.

I'm passionate about open source but haven't had time to dedicate to developing libraries.

Although Sagewill is a commercial product, I'm hoping it will lend itself to some open-source opportunities 💪
