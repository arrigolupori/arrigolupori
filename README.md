Hey there 👋🏼
========================

I'm Arrigo 🤓

*   🇮🇹  I'm based in Firenze, Italy
*   🧑🏼‍💼  Currently I work as the Head of Marketing for [Datavid](https://datavid.com)

Open source is a HUGE passion for me.

I often dive deep into repos and sponsor fellow opensourcerers. My time is limited at the moment, but I have the ambition to create relevant open-source projects for the community. Check back here in a few months' time!
